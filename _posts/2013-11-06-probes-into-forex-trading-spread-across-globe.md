We think we understand consent. When someone is not coerced into doing something they consent, right? Yet a more realistic view recognizes that there is always some force of "coercion" that is influencing any given decision and that particularly in our modern world we accept "formal" consent far too often - leaving actual or "joyful" consent on the cutting room floor.

Perhaps the most stark example comes from sex. It is easy to categorize "violent rape" as "without consent". But in our modern era, the continuum is complicated. What about rape where the violence is implict or only hinted at? What about a version of 'date rape' where there is no obvious threat of violence?

Then farther down the continuum - prostitution. Transactional sex. While it is certainly possible for there to be "joyful" sex in prostitution, it is more often the case that it is "non-joyful consent".

The focus on "joyful" in consent here is a clear effort to get to relationships that are intended to go beyond the merely transactional where all parties involved are there because they really want to be and have a mutual commitment to the relationship.
