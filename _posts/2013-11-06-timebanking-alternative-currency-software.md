    content: <p>I would be potentially interested in building a WordPress plugin for this. I think that would be the best platform for this as it already has a solid foundation in the user and social aspects of what you are looking for. WP plugins can be very powerful and I'm am just getting getting into this sphere.</p><p>However, I have a giant list of projects to attack and it may be months (years?) until I have time to attack this head on. But I would advice to build it from scratch and build it on WordPress. I can argue more details if you like.</p>

        content: <p>Awesome thank you to both Casey and Mark. I think I'm going to reach out to Drew Little and see if he has time to tell me about his Producia/WordPress plugins. I've also reached out of our local timebanking volunteer with the most ITtech experience, and he's willing to participate in some of those conversations.</p><p>Casey, recognizing that you have limited time to actually develop at the moment, any chance you would still be interested in talking with Drew and me if I can get it scheduled? It'd be helpful to me for someone with more technical experience than me to participate in those conversations too.</p>

I spent the past year launching a timebank in Staunton that uses the Community Weaver software available at www.timebanks.org, written in Drupal. The whole idea of timebanking is to create an alternative currency based on time rather than money, and to have an online site that lets members list talents to "sell", request services they want to "purchase," and to track hours exchanged with other timebank members.
</p>
<p>
One year in, our local timebank has over 200 members and the software is basically tolerable but only sortof (it's geared towards neighborhood or tight geographical projects, its internal communication system sucks in that it doesn't play well with mobile/facebook/gmail/outside systems, it lacks adequate feedback opportunities within the system, and people must choose to login to the software itself to see updated listings rather than having an automatic feed). Which is to say, people who are committed to the project make do with the software, but it's not winning us any new recruits.
</p>
<p>
There has been some good discussion about whether a game~b timebank makes sense for internal usage among members. And also whether a better timebanking software could be one of our "gifts" or projects that could be used by game~b local chapters and affiliated groups.
</p>
<p>
So, questions...
</p>
<p>
(1) Is anyone aware of a better open source alternative out there?
</p>
<p>
(2) If not, how much effort do you think it would take to make this software or other software more workable? (Timebanks.org currently has a tech crew on upgrades, but it's slow and painful)
</p>
<p>
(3) Were we instead to design from scratch, what scale of resources (time/energy/money) do you think it would take to build a new system that fulfills more elegantly the basic timebanking requirements?
</p>
<p>
Thanks all!
